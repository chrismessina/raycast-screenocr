ScreenOCR allows you to quickly and easily extract text from screen captures via OCR, perfect for extracting text from any on-screen content. <br>
All processing is done locally on device via Apple's VisionKit ML API.

**Note**: This extension requires "Screen Recording" permission to work (it's the only way to capture screenshots)
